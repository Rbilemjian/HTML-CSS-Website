            <p>
                In the last year, I have been going to the gym on a consistent basis. It is one of the best habits I have ever picked up. The benefits of hitting the gym consistently are great. More energy, better discipline, meeting all kinds of people and a sense of comradery with gym buddies. It is great and I would higly recommend it to anybody, especially over at the gym I go to which is open 24/7 and only costs $10/month.

            <h3>The Gym</h3>
            <p>
                I go to Crunch Northridge, where membership for just that gym is $10 every month and it is open every day of the week, 24 hours a day. The downside to this gym is that it can get to be pretty crowded. They just recently added a third squat rack, though, so it is a lot less congested especially on leg days.

            <h3>The Schedule</h3>
            <p>
                This is the schedule that I follow weekly for going to the gym. It used to be upper body 3 times a week, but with school again and how inconsistent that schedule was with days changing all the time, I decided to make it 2 times a week so that the schedule remains constant and I have more time for schoolwork.
